# Market Analysis on GANs in Finance
This paper discusses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), mainly focusing on their application in Finance. I did not take care of the technician aspects of the technology, but instead, I conducted market research on it.

The paper will describe the technology (section 1), also looking at it from a broader perspective (section 2). Then, taking as example the financial time series modelling task, it will compare GANs with the most relevant models used to accomplish it — i.e.,  ARCH/GARCH and ABMs  — trying to figure out the technology delta (section 3). This document will also analyze the barriers for an entity that tries to enter the market with a business model that involves this technology (section 4). Moreover, I will describe a possible future scenario in which GANs are state-of-the-art and the business role that might develop due to their increasing usage (section 5). Finally, I will consider the current adoption of this network in the industry and how it can dramatically change in the years (section 6).
